The main isssues that I've had with this project were the dependency conflicts and not being able to reference the d3 libraray within the scope of the component js. Being new to ember, I had issues with the build. Depending on the packages I installed the project wouldn't build. For example you could run ember install ember-charts which should include d3 but would not be able to reference d3.js and cause the build to break.

Also the syntax for referencing d3 packages is slighlty different than if we were using native javascript or a different framework. For exampe select is imported using import { select } from 'd3-selection' versus having d3 loaded in on a script tag and having the variable d3 on the global scope. Ulimately I wanted to use d3-pie or d3-arc for the pie chart but they could not be referenced or imported within the ember components. To debug this, I researched similar implementations (which didn't take advantage of the framework). I changed up my dependencies. I uninstalled and reinstalled all the packages as well as updated them/rolled back. I did several implementations on multiple branches. I read through the documentation. My next step would be to read through the packages themselves.

Recently I have made a page that dynamiclly generates charts that give realtime feedback on rest calls. So the concept is fairly straightforward.
